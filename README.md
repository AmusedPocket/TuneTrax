Flask, SQL Alchemy, AWS S3, POSTGRESQL, and Docker were used to create the database and backend routes. 

Database schema [link here][1].

Routes used with Flask for:
 * Songs
 * Albums
 * Playlists
 * User
 * Authentication

File upload and deletion is handled by AWS S3.

Hosting is managed by Render.

## Frontend Technology

React, Redux, React-H5-Audio-Player, React-Infinite-Scroller, Wavesurfer, and Font-Awesome were used to create the front-end functionality

## Conclusion

Our Team picked up Python in a week for this project and wrote the backend API in this new language. As our first foyer into the Flask development cycle our team worked hard to understand how it's implementation should be handled and succeeded in making this project in the short time frame available. We still currently meet frequently to ensure that the project is staying up to date and gaining new features!
